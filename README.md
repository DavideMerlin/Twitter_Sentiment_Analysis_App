# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_App
This app analyzes Tweets and performs a Sentiment Analysis to see how positive or negative each tweet is about whatever topic we choose. It uses tweepy to get access to the Twitter API (where I create a profile as a develop and created an app), and TextBlob library to perform the Sentiment Analysis on the Tweets.
